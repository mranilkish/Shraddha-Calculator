# Shraddha-Calculator
Shraddha Calculator calculates auspicious dates for performing rituals to decesed members.

If you are not aware of death time or in case of missing person or information, <br>you can do rituals on Pitru Paksha(15 days)(starts from 11th day after Vinayaka Chaviti) or amavasyas of all months.

Disclaim:The thiti calculation takes little long time for dispalying information dont repress the function or dont force stop the script.
